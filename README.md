# Portfolio v3.2 â€“ Feedback Welcome ðŸŽ¯

Hi! I'm a 3rd year BSIS (Bachelor of Science in Information Systems) student currently self-learning modern tech stacks alongside my coursework. I've built this portfolio to showcase my skills and projects as I prepare for internships and eventually enter the tech industry.

ðŸ§  Self-taught Resources Used:
- FreeCodeCamp
- The Odin Project
- LeetCode
- Google Developers Program
- YouTube & More

ðŸš€ Portfolio Live Site:  
[https://property360-2.github.io/portfolio-v3.2/](https://property360-2.github.io/portfolio-v3.2/)

ðŸ‘€ I'm looking for feedback:
- Is anything missing from the portfolio?
- Does it align with BSIS expectations?
- Any internship tips for someone entering their final year?

Feel free to open an issue or leave commentsâ€”any advice is greatly appreciated!
